I'm Alex Cureton-Griffiths. I'm a coder, maker, traveler, coffee addict and general techie. I travel around a lot and love tinkering with stuff.

I've been involved with some cool projects, including open-source aerospace technology, open-source ecovillages, and most recently an open-source microservice platform (seeing a pattern here?)

In my spare time you can find me at a coffeeshop, pub, or makerspace, hacking away on some project or other.
