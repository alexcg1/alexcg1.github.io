<p>I’m super excited to be heading to <a href="http://www.makermela.com/">Maker Mela</a> in Mumbai in a few days. My first time in India and I’m looking forward to meeting the local maker community!</p>

<p>I’ll be showcasing some of the projects I’ve been working on, potentially including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cyborg Beast prosthetic hand</strong> - a 3D-printable open-source prosthetic</li>
  <li><strong>K8e</strong> - a voice-activated robot pet dog, still very much a work-in-progress</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.spacegambit.org">SpaceGAMBIT</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Can’t wait to see you all there!</p>
