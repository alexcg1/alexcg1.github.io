<p>With all the questions about ethics and technology lately, especially Facebook data collection and Cambridge Analytica, it seems a good time to introduce the concept of <em>Nerdsightnedness</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>n.</em> The inability to see beyond a technology’s interesting technical aspects, particularly to miss its ethical implications; to see the world from the perspective of a nerd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, as Jurassic Park put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should!</p>
