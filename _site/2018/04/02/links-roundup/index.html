<p>One of the reasons I was invited to be part of the Remix team is because I’m a geek and a maker, as I’m sure many of our users are. With that in mind, here are a bunch of links that I find useful as a geek, maker, and technologist/futurist in general:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a></strong> – a roundup of all the latest tech news, gathered by members of the Y Combinator community.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.lobste.rs">Lobste.rs</a></strong> – similar to Hacker News, but smaller. Still has some interesting daily links though.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boingboing</a>, <a href="http://www.kottke.org">Kottke</a> and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">Metafilter</a></strong> – Three blogs that have been going forever. They cover all sorts of things, including (but certainly not limited to) maker culture, technology and digital rights.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com">io9</a></strong> – Without the inspiration of science fiction you wouldn’t have your shiny iPad or iPhone. io9 collects the latest news about sci-fi books, movies, and TV.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></strong> – Reddit is a community-determined aggregator of content. It is a social platform where users submit posts that other users ‘upvote’ or ‘downvote’ based on if they like it. I follow just a few subreddits including <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource">opensource</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience">askscience</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians">askhistorians</a></li>
</ul>
