<p>I’ve recently been putting a lot of hours into levelling up my computer science and coding, mostly covering Python, Tensorflow, machine learning, and a few little projects to scratch personal itches.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I’ve got a nice little workflow going. Here are some of the things I do:</p>

<h2 id="make-the-most-of-free-resources">Make the Most of Free Resources</h2>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://www.coursera">Coursera</a> for their course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer">Nand2Tetris</a>, and <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT’s Open Courseware</a> for their courses on Python and data science. I’m especially a fan of MIT’s offering because it doesn’t ask for you to sign up – something that’s more of a concern in these days of massive Facebook data breaches.</p>

<h2 id="pop-out-youtube-videos">Pop Out Youtube Videos</h2>

<p>While the above sites are good, I have to keep their page open in my browser to view the video on my laptop screen. Luckily MIT’s videos are all on Youtube too, so I use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-popout-player/?src=search">Youtube Popout Player</a> extension for Firefox. With that, and my Linux desktop allowing me to keep certain windows on top, I can play the video in the corner of my desktop while focusing on the code in my editor.</p>

<h2 id="use-jupyter-notebook">Use Jupyter Notebook</h2>

<p>I’d played with <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> a fair bit before, but didn’t really see the point. Why bother when I have <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>?</p>

<p>But since we use Jupyter at Remix, I thought I should play with it a bit more, and I’m starting to fall in love, especially with their tab completion and special commands. It’s a bit of a pain to set up if you’re unfamiliar with <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> or the command line, but well worth it. Having said that, I wouldn’t say it’s great for everything. Learning coding and data science? Sure. Building programs that do file IO, web serving, or need GUIs? Maybe not so much.</p>

<p>Now I’ve started playing with <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab">JupyterLab</a>, the next generation of Jupyter Notebook. It’s even more of an IDE, and I’m just getting started learning the new features. So far, so good!</p>
