I use a bunch of open source Android apps as my daily drivers. Since they quite often come up in conversation, I'm making a list here. Note that I didn't want to manually dig out the URL for every single app, so I relied a bit on GPT to find links, write descriptions. If anything seems off, I recommend you search for the app directly.

## App Stores

To install these apps, I recommend [F-Droid app store](https://f-droid.org/), which lists only open-source apps. Some may only be available from [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) which pulls directly from GitHub releases.

## Must Haves
