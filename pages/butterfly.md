This page is a work-in-progress list of frequently-asked questions about my ongoing butterfly project.

### What Is It?

It's a piece of jewelry that sits on you and moves like a real life-size (more or less) butterfly.

### Can I Buy One?

Right now I'm still working on building the thing. I'm looking to potentially sell them in future though.

### Why Do This?

I had a dream one night that I was covered in butterflies. I woke up and wondered how to make that a reality. Then I wondered how to _ethically_ make it a reality. Hence this project.

### Can It Fly?

No.

### _Why_ Can't It Fly?

- First of all, having jewelry that flies away from you feels like a bad investment.
- Secondly, it's bloody difficult. Getting something tiny to lift its own weight is tough. The battery would have to big, which adds weight, which means you'd need a bigger battery to give the power to lift that weight, and a bigger battery adds _more_ weight, etc, et bloody cetera.
- Third, if I could make life-size flying butterflies I'd already be rich (and likely guilty from the nefarious purposes they could be put to). From what I've seen, the only places doing that are specialist labs building nano-drones, and even those are tethered (i.e. attached to their power source), not standalone.

### Does It _Really_ Move Like A Butterfly?

In short, it probably moves like _you_ think a butterfly moves, more or less.

- Most people's images of butterflies are [_dead butterflies_](https://www.emilydamstra.com/please-enough-dead-butterflies/). So that's what my butterfly looks like. Like the mental image of a living butterfly to _most_ humans. ([Lepidopterists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidopterology), I'm happy to make custom versions, just so I can be scientifically accurate for once in this mad scheme).
- It has two wings, not four. If you look at most depictions of butterflies, this is what they use.
- Humans tend to like regularity. Butterflies have an element of randomness in their flap. But if a machine moves just a little bit randomly, it looks weird, like you're looking at a clock with a crazy rhythm.

_Note: I can happily build in randomization, and that may be an option in future. The four-wing movement might be trickier_

### How Did You Get The Skills To Make It?

Trial and error. A _lot_ of trial and error. And learning from my friends at [hackerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace).

### I Don't Like Butterflies. Can You Make Me _XXX_?

If it flaps I can probably make it. Dragons, angels, birds, bats. Uh, sea turtles, since I guess they "fly" underwater". If it's a flippity-flappity thing you want, I can probably make it.

### I Want A Really Big Butterfly/Angel/Bird. Can You Make That?

Hell yes. Bigger is way easier than the size I'm currently working with.

### Does It Use AI? Bitcoin? Internet Of Things? Bluetooth? Wifi?

To the first two, Hell no. For IoT, Bluetooth, wifi, I suppose they _could_ be options, but I can't really see a use case at the moment.

### Does It Do Anything Else Or Just Sit There And Flap?

Right now, it just sits there and flaps. I've got some ideas about introducing bundles for couples, where the butterflies flap faster the closer you are together, or butterflies that flap to the beat of whatever music is playing, or LED displays on the wings you can control from your phone. They're all doable, but not yet a priority.

### Do You Want Any Help With It?

On the technical side, I'm having a blast learning it all myself. On production, marketing, sales, etc. That's still a long way off, if ever.

### How Many Years Of Your Life Have You ~~Wasted~~ Spent On This Project?

Too many. Far too many.

### You Must Really Love Butterflies, Right?

Usually, yes. But some days, I think there's no one in the world who hates them as much as I do. They're fiddly little buggers to get right.

### Do You Have More Pictures Or Videos?

I'm in the process of uploading them.
