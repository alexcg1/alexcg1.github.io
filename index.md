<p id="describe-text">About Alex</p>
<br>
I'm Alex C-G - I'm the Developer Relations Lead at Jina AI. 

Most of the projects in my GitHub profile are written in Python, though I also muck around with Arduino and have the usual smattering of shell scripts, Markdown and whatnot.

I like to think of myself as not that hardcore and kinda approachable. But then I remember I live in vim full-time, taught an AI to write crappy Star Trek, and am building robotic butterflies for fun. Eh, so maybe I'm a little hardcore.
