## Medprint

Medprint is web platform (currently under development) to connect makers making PPE with hospitals in need. I'm the lead developer of the front-end, which is based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework.

Medprint is being worked on by myself (in New Zealand) and a small team in Germany. It integrates with Gitlab (for project repository hosting) and [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) (a web interface for controlling 3D printers)

## SpaceGAMBIT

SpaceGAMBIT was an open-source space program funded by DARPA. We funded over 20 open-source aerospace projects worldwide, partnered with NASA on their Asteroid Grand Challenge, and wrote a white paper for the White House.
